# Advent of Code 2019

You can steal my work, use the `puzzlehandler` package in your own code!  Add this line to your `Cargo.toml`:

```
puzzlehandler = { git = "https://github.com/zeiv/advent-of-code-2019" }
```

To add a new package for a new day, simply use `cargo new`, since Git is already initialized at the root it will not re-init:

```
cargo new day7
```
